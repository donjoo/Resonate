# 📇 Contacts App

A responsive **Contacts Application** built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This app fetches contact data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and allows users to:

- View a list of contacts
- Search for contacts by name
- Click on a contact to view more details in a modal

No Create, Update, or Delete (CRUD) functionality is implemented — this is a read-only browsing app.
